We are looking for an experienced developer to integrate PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) functionality into our existing billing system. The goal is to automate the disconnection process for clients using MikroTik routers based on their billing status.

PPoE Configuration: Implement and configure PPPoE on our billing system to facilitate automated disconnection for clients.
MikroTik Integration: Work with MikroTik’s API or other methods to ensure seamless communication between our billing system and MikroTik routers.
Automated Disconnection: Develop a reliable mechanism to disconnect clients from the network when their billing status changes (e.g., overdue payments).
Testing and Troubleshooting: Conduct thorough testing to ensure functionality works as expected and resolve any issues that arise during the implementation.
Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the implementation process and any configurations made for future reference.
