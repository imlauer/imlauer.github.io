Yes, Google has significantly reduced its use of the "Don't be evil" motto over time, though it hasn't been entirely eradicated from all company materials.

### Key Timeline and Details:
- **Origins (2004)**: The phrase originated in Google's IPO prospectus as part of a letter from founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, emphasizing ethical business practices over short-term gains. It was never officially the company's motto but became an informal guiding principle, appearing in Google's Code of Conduct.
- **2015 Restructuring**: When Google restructured under parent company Alphabet, Alphabet adopted a new principle: "Do the right thing." Google retained "Don't be evil" in its own Code of Conduct at the time.
- **2018 Changes**: Google quietly removed most references to the phrase from its Code of Conduct preface and early sections, leaving it only as a brief mention at the very end: "And remember… don’t be evil, and if you see something that you think isn’t right – speak up." This drew criticism, as the motto had been used to highlight ethical concerns (e.g., employee protests over military contracts).
- **Post-2018 Status**: As of the latest available updates (around 2020–2021), the phrase remains in that single closing line of Google's Code of Conduct, but it's no longer prominently featured on user-facing pages or in broader corporate philosophy. By 2018, it was also absent from Alphabet's overarching guidelines.

The shift reflects growing scrutiny over Google's practices (e.g., privacy, advertising, and AI ethics), making the absolute imperative of "Don't be evil" harder to uphold publicly. Critics argue it was always more aspirational than enforceable, and its dilution symbolizes a move toward vaguer principles like "doing the right thing."
