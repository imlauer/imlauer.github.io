## 🧭 STEP-BY-STEP PLAN

### 🔹 1. **Download all your data (optional backup)**

Before deleting anything, back up your Gmail and Google Drive data:

* Go to 👉 [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/)
* Select what you want to download (emails, contacts, Drive files, etc.)
* Click **“Next step” → “Export”** and wait for the download link.

---

### 🔹 2. **Check what apps and devices are linked**

* Go to 👉 [myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
* Scroll to **“Your devices”** → remove every device you no longer use.
* Scroll to **“Third-party apps with account access”** → click each one → **Remove access**.

💡 *This cuts off all apps, websites, and services that use your Gmail to log in.*

---

### 🔹 3. **Update logins in important accounts**

Many sites (banks, subscriptions, etc.) use your Gmail to:

* Receive password resets
* Sign in with “Google Login”

You should:

* Visit each important site and **change the login email** to the new person’s email (or your alternate account if you’re not giving them access).
* If you can’t change it, at least **remove your Google login** and create a separate username/password for them.

You can find these sites easily:

* Go to [https://myaccount.google.com/permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
* That’s a full list of every app/site that ever used “Sign in with Google”.

---

### 🔹 4. **Transfer or share data manually (if giving it to someone)**

If you’re trying to **transfer data to another person** (like documents, photos, etc.):

* **Drive** → share files or folders with their new Gmail.
* **Google Photos** → use Partner Sharing.
* **Contacts** → export and send as `.vcf`.
* **Calendar** → share or export.

---

### 🔹 5. **Remove recovery methods**

* Go to [myaccount.google.com/security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
* Remove your **phone number** and **recovery email**.

---

### 🔹 6. **Sign out everywhere**

* On the same security page, scroll to **“Your devices” → Sign out on all devices**.

---

### 🔹 7. **Delete the Gmail account (optional)**

If you truly want to remove it:

* Go to [myaccount.google.com/delete-services](https://myaccount.google.com/delete-services)
* Choose **“Delete Gmail”**
* Follow the prompts (you’ll be asked for another email to keep the Google account alive — or delete the entire account if you prefer).

---

### 🔹 8. **Double-check all dependencies**

Before final deletion:

* Check YouTube channels (they may vanish with your Gmail)
* Check Play Store apps
* Check Android devices linked (backup photos, contacts, etc.)
* Check password manager (if you used Google Passwords)

---

## ⚠️ Important

You can’t **give** your Gmail address to someone else directly (e.g., change ownership).
The safest way is to:

1. Transfer or share the data,
2. Delete your Gmail,
3. Let the other person create their **own Gmail**.
