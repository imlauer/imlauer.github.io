You do not need a CEX. Just buy it witouth KYC using HodlHodl, lnp2pbot in Telegram or just but it direct with your hardware wallet using Trezor Suite, BitBoxApp, etc.

great question! you can use peer to peer platforms like Bisq or RoboSats to buy Bitcoin without an exchange. just make sure to use a non custodial wallet like Sparrow or BlueWallet for true ownership!

If you want to own BTC like gold, get a self-custody wallet. Bitget Wallet helps you buy & hold Bitcoin safely—no middlemen, no exchange risks Plus zero swap fees for new users, right now
