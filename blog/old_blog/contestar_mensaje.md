Hi name
Would you be available for a meeting to discuss a project to configure 4 Linode virtual private servers (2 web servers and 2 database servers) ?

I am a single developer, not part of any company, who is creating a small web hosting business to rent packaged Next.js websites to small businesses in the U.S.

Are you available for a meeting. If yes, I will send you scheduling details.

Thanks.

Best Regards;
Rich Howland
