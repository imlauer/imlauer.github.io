## ✅ What to *do*

If you want a **real Gopher site on a Gopher server for free**:

1. **Sign up for SDF** — that’s your best bet for a no-cost Gopher-friendly host.
2. Once on SDF:

   * Use their shell to upload your directory tree.
   * Use a Gopher server daemon they support (or just put files in a `~/public_gopher/` directory if available).
3. Use software like **Gophernicus** or **Motsognir** (both open-source) to run your gopher server.

   * Gophernicus: modern, secure. ([GitHub][3])
   * Motsognir: lightweight, easy to configure. ([motsognir.sourceforge.net][4])
