Looking for someone to help set up and run Indexhibit within a Docker (docker compose) environment. The ideal candidate should have experience with Docker deployment and familiarity with Indexhibit.
https://forum.indexhibit.org/tutorials/getting-started/installation/
Got basic php/mysql docker up and running. can install indexhibit, but file upload does not work. The file gets uploaded but the entry doesn't get written to the database.
Running it on a (non-docker) regular install everything works fine.

Have docker-compose.yml I can share


Probablemente una mala conexión con la base de datos en el docker-compose.yml
