> We are looking for a skilled developer to enhance the file upload functionality on our existing website built with PHP and MySQL. Currently, the system only accepts PDF files, and we need it modified to support additional file types. The ideal candidate will be experienced in PHP programming and have a strong understanding of file handling in web applications. If you are detail-oriented and can ensure secure and efficient file uploads, we would love to hear from you.
