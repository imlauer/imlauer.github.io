I was born in Argentina. I studied Computer Science from Universidad Nacional de Rosario. Now I'm studying electricity.   
   
I've been doing various minimum wage jobs such as cleaning, computer repair and camera installation.   
   
My online nicks are esotericwarfare, atavistic11.   
   
Here is a photo of [me](https://miinstagram.github.io/me/mpv-shot0034.jpg).   
   
#### Fun facts about me:   
   
* I used to study computer science but dropped it.   
* I am studying electricity because I like things that can actually shock me, not just bore me.   
* Capitalism is going to die unless we ban ads and separate of church and state including universities.
* I support [Wireheading city](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2023/04/11/wireheading-city.html).   
* Everything is a lie: news, porn, music, education, democracy. It's all manipulation.   
* Public Universities are taxpayer-funded scams.   
* Feminism is a male construct designed to oppress other men.   
* COVID-19 pandemic was a planned laboratory creation: Deaths from nukes: 226,000 - "Deaths" from COVID: 3,250,648. Complete nonsense.
* Civilization will end in a decade or two.   
* Free will doesn't exist.   
* Ads should be illegal? Advertising is like fishing, but you're the one who ends up getting caught.
* Bitcoin's value is purely "human stupidity".   
* Voting is pointless: zero sum games are the problem and I don't see any politician talking about it.    
* Schools don't measure intelligence, they measure "alignment with their interests" and train you for "slavery". True prodigies, like programmers and chess masters, simply drop out. ( [Tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Ptopme84Vw) ).
School blocks real education.   
* Work is better than school ( [The toxic schooling system](https://digdeeper.love/articles/school.xhtml) )   
* Everyone oppresses everyone else: human existence itself is pure egoism.</li>   
* Google's self-driving cars? Fake, controlled by humans. Amazon's AI supermarkets? Also fake, staffed by 100 Indians. [Spotify](http://stallman.org/spotify.html) lies about song popularity, YouTube hides dislikes, and social media exists purely for mass espionage and selling ads to fellow scammers. Ex-Twitter show fake "trends".   
* As a natural leader, you have no need for validation from anyone. You view the entire education system as a manipulative tool designed to train "slaves" to constantly seek external approval.   
* Social media is a tool for mass espionage, addiction, and selling ads to exploit society.   
* Due to my laptop's slow performance, I spoof my User-Agent to make it seem like I'm accessing from an Android device, which allows me to load resource-intensive sites like Twitch and YouTube more quickly.
* Be the seller, not the buyer.   
* C++ was created to only sell expensive books and live off of them.   
* The power isn't what you have, it's what people believe you have.   
* Most jobs are fake.   
* **[Zero sum games are bad](https://ibb.co/Rkm9JC39): patent trolls, finance, sales, real estate, tip screen design, fake jobs, social media influencers, advertising.**
* Statistics are a new form of advertising.   
* For Zoomers a mail client is an "app".   
* Vibecoding is a scam: You're still doing the coding, you're just using a different language (English, in this case), and English is a poor language for coding due to its imprecision. The moment you need to accomplish something new, you'll have to be as specific as possible, and the only reason it works for many common programming workflows is because they are common, the minute you try to do new things, you need to be as verbose as the underlying language. 
* In Argentina, internet service providers like Claro, Personal, and Movistar block access to LibreFutbol by DNS, due to few customers are willing to pay for the premium channels, Google removes all the piracy links which is why I use Yandex and torrent search with **qBitTorrent** with **Jackett**.
Here's a rewritten version of your statement:
* I believe most of **social media influencers are psychopaths** that are willing to promote any scam like VPN scams and online gambling, in order to profit from their followers. 
* The fewer dependencies you have, the better: Having fewer dependencies makes it easier to maintain that's why I use `pandoc` and `markdown` and can just use html also or `cmark` that's more minimalistic than `pandoc`.

### People who I look up to

* George Hotz: [Blog](https://geohot.github.io/blog). In this video he teachs you: [how not to be a noob](https://www.youtube.com/embed/-v8pD0d5Bmk). [Spanish text of George Hotz talking about zero sums games](/geohot.html). 

##### Articles I recommend reading from his blog:   

1. Class Warfare: [https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2021/09/28/class-warfare.html](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2021/09/28/class-warfare.html)   
2. Pieces of shit: [https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2021/04/20/sell-outs.html](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2021/04/20/sell-outs.html)   
3. consumer class divide: [https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2022/02/02/consumer-class-divide.html](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2022/02/02/consumer-class-divide.html)
