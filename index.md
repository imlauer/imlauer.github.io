I was born in 1995 and I live in Argentina. I studied Computer Science from Universidad Nacional de Rosario. Now I'm studying electricity.

I've been doing various minimum wage jobs such as cleaning, computer repair and camera installation.

My online nicks are esotericwarfare, atavistic11.

Here is a photo of [me](https://miinstagram.github.io/me/mpv-shot0034.jpg).

#### Fun facts about me:

* I am studying electricity because I like things that can actually shock me, not just bore me.
* I used to study computer science but dropped it.
* Capitalism is going to die: Capitalism has no morals; it’s pure consumption.
* I support [Wireheading city](https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2023/04/11/wireheading-city.html).
* Everything is a lie: news, porn, music, education, democracy. It's all manipulation.
* Public Universities are taxpayer-funded scams.
* Feminism is a male construct designed to oppress other men.
* COVID-19 pandemic was a planned laboratory creation.
* Civilization will end in a decade or two.
* Free will doesn't exist.
* Ads should be ilegal?
* Bitcoin's value is purely "human stupidity"
* Voting is pointless.
* Schools don't measure intelligence, they measure "alignment with their interests" and train you for "slavery". True prodigies, like programmers and chess masters, simply drop out. ( [Tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Ptopme84Vw)
School blocks real education.
* Work is better than school ( [The toxic schooling system](https://digdeeper.love/articles/school.xhtml) )

* As a natural leader, you have no need for validation from anyone. You view the entire education system as a manipulative tool designed to train "slaves" to constantly seek external approval.
* Social media is a tool for mass espionage, addiction, and selling ads to exploit society.
