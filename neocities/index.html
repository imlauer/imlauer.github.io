<p>I was born in Argentina. I studied Computer Science from <a
href="https://dcc.fceia.unr.edu.ar/es/lcc/materias">Universidad Nacional
de Rosario(Spanish)</a>. I once found a SQL Injection vulnerability on
the old website. Now I’m studying electricity.</p>
<p>My online nicknames are esotericwarfare, atavistic11.</p>

<h4>Rule number 1: don’t be a sellout. Money is fake and you can’t buy a
country’s sovereignty. Don’t change your way of thinking for money. Like
Facebook employees who sell their soul to fry on private jets. Facebook,
Google, Amazon, Spotify are ads companies not “tech” companies.</h4>
<p>The biggest problems are <a

<p><em>I want money. I have high TC. I get big compensation. I advance in my career. I have many business opportunity. I am senior employee. I have many reports. I have big package. I am important. I fly on private jet. I party with model. I go to prestigious school. I have piece of paper with school logo. I think people still have no idea how fake the US economy is, and how bad it will get over the next 20 years. I used to think that this was just a phenomenon in tech, but now tech is everything. If nobody is creating the value and everyone is trying to
cannibalize, eventually there is nothing left.</em> - George Hotz

<li>Uber exploits people who are not good at math. When you factor in the cost of gas and car maintenance, you actually end up losing money.<br/></li>
<li>Public education should be developing decentralized, free software
to evade corrupt governments and decentralized
cryptocurrencies—alternatives to make us free. Not forcing us to take
all those exams that serve no purpose other than putting a logo on a
piece of paper. That’s academic bullshit.<br />

<li><strong>Financing with advertising is equivalent to financing with
taxes</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li>Javascript was a mistake: Modern frontends so are bloated due to the

nonsense.<br />
</li>
<li>Technology has made access cheaper and more convenient — streaming
music, movies, or storing data online costs far less than buying
physical media. However, this convenience comes with a trade-off:
<strong>users no truly own anything anymore</strong>.<br />
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html">Proprietary Software Is Often Malware. </a> <br/></li>
<li>Flash and JavaScript are used for "fingerprinting" devices to identify users.<br/></li>
<li><strong>All content and services are locked behind subscriptions and
centralized platforms. If access is revoked or payment stops, everything
— music, photos, data, even communication — can disappear
instantly</strong>. This creates digital dependency and corporate
control, where participation in modern life often requires a credit card
and compliance with corporate systems. This is not what tech is about,
this is against technology.<br />
</li>
<li>Free will doesn’t exist.<br />
</li>
<li>Ads should be illegal. Advertising is like fishing, but you’re the
one who ends up getting caught.<br />
</li>
<li>Today, the internet is flooded with ads and manipulation, but “tech
companies” claim to care about stopping the spread of misinformation.
The irony is that their entire business model relies on showing us fake
ads.<br />

<li><strong><a

<li><strong>Voting is manipulation</strong>: zero-sum games are the
problem and I don’t see any politician talking about it. Additionally,
most working people don’t have the time to stay informed about the news,

<li>How to get girls: “Girls just wanna have fun”. The nightclub was
made for women, women like to dance with their friends and receive male

<li>The more beautiful, the bigger bitch a woman is.<br/></li>
<li>Marriage never benefits the man, always the woman, because the woman

<li>The goal of computer science is to automate all jobs. The more
computing advances, the more people lose work. That’s why there is no
real money in tech: if you are honest, each passing year programming
work gets harder and pays worse.<br />
</li>
<li>If you are a con artist like Mark Zuckerberg—whose core aim is to
make you addicted to your phone to show you ads—or companies like <a
href="http://stallman.org/spotify.html">Spotify</a>, Tinder that charges
the same to men and women and Tinder doesn’t ask the body count (very
important question if you’re looking for some casual sex) or Ex-Twitter
show fake “trends”, then you can make money. Companies like <a
href="http://stallman.org/netflix.html">Netflix</a> that turned people
who once used torrents into paying subscribers, or Google that censors
piracy and sites without Google Adsense while promoting Reddit, or Udemy
selling low-quality courses, or all the aggressive marketing that pushes
you to create accounts on shady sites or crypto scams. But that is NOT
technology; technology is supposed to improve our lives, not make us
addicted to advertising or be Ponzi-style scams or zero-sum games.<br />
</li>
<li>OpenAI has 2 lies: it's not open and it's not AI, it's a LLM.<br/>
</li>
<li>Tech companies intentionally worsen their products to make more
money. Programming died ten years ago; they tried to delay artificial
intelligence because they want to live off fake jobs a computer can
do.<br />
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes">Elizabeth
Holmes</a> was used as a scapegoat—unjustly blamed for a larger failure.
The investors who put money into that mess should be thoroughly
investigated.<br />
</li>
<li>In technology there is no real money. Most people didn’t care about
tech; they came because they heard there was money and then scammed
others: <a href="http://stallman.org/spotify.html">Spotify</a>
manipulates song popularity; YouTube removed dislikes; Facebook
maximizes phone addiction to show as much advertising as possible.<br />
</li>
<li>The original purpose of <strong>Bitcoin was to destroy banks and
evade taxes</strong>. The fact that banks now sell Bitcoin demonstrates
they are working against the technology’s initial goals.<br />
</li>
<li>There is no money in technology: <strong>most tech companies lie to
society because they know people will buy stocks without understanding
the product</strong>. Examples: Elizabeth Holmes raised hundreds of
millions and valued Theranos at $9 billion while deceiving
investors.<br />
</li>
<li>The COVID origin debate persists?… It came from a lab.<br />
</li>
<li>What matters to Facebook/Meta is maximizing phone addiction to show
as much advertising as possible. They may think it’s genius, but it’s
fraud. Advertising should be illegal or heavily taxed so it’s not
profitable. If we abolish advertising, many so-called journalists would
have to work in construction, and the country would improve.<br />
</li>
<li>Teachers punish students for using Artificial Intelligence—again the
education system fails to encourage critical thinking.<br />
</li>
<li><em>“You heard there was money and status in tech. You applied. You
never cared about technology; you wanted to get rich. You’re a parasitic
infiltrator. It’s time for you to leave. You won’t go voluntarily. We

here.”</em> - George Hotz.<br />

<li>In poor countries the struggle is not against nature but against
zero-sum games and scams. Real economic growth is only about 3% — any

<li>“The simplification changes the meaning” - Richard Stallman.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>For marketing, the truth doesn’t matter, what only matter is
what sells and raises stock prices</strong>. <em>YouTube removed
dislikes and promotes youtube-shorts to show more ads</em>, then they
“worry” and remove videos for “misinformation”.<br />
</li>
<li>Before Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, people used P2P networks like
Ares, Emule, Torrent to share music, but everything was corrupted by
power, if you don’t believe me, watch this <a

<li><em>If a guy squeezes a girl’s breast without consent, he doesn’t
physically hurt her in any way, the girl is completely fine, it’s just
that society will tell her she was “raped” by this and should now start
suffering from PTSD, she’s labeled a “victim”, assigned a psychiatrist,
will be pumped with drugs and told she has an increased chance of
committing suicide now. In a good society this would simply not be the
case, mild non-consensual sexual behavior such as touching, spying,
masturbation etc. might be at worst as much harmful as for example
non-consensual small talk or farting in someone’s presence without his
approval. Again, physically harming someone is WRONG, but do we have to
equate such an extreme form of rape with slapping a girl’s ass? By doing
so we are probably hurting the “victims” more than the “offenders”. But
again, this helps separate people into two groups: “raped” and “not
raped”, “victims” and “predators” and so on.</em> - LRS Wiki.<br />

<li>Vibecoding(prompt engineering) is a scam: You’re still doing the
coding, you’re just using a different language (English, in this case),
and English is a poor language for coding due to its imprecision. The
moment you need to accomplish something new, you’ll have to be as
specific as possible, and the only reason it works for many common
programming workflows is because they are common, the minute you try to
do new things, you need to be as verbose as the underlying
language.<br />

<li>In Argentina, internet service providers like Claro, Personal, and

advisable to use Tor and not a VPN. If you still want to use want,

<li>“Tech companies” (BigTech) realized they couldn’t make money from

<p><em>Do you know someone who works in real estate, finance, sales, tip
screen design, or advertising? You can nudge them in the right
direction! Explain to them how their job is making the world worse. How
if everyone behaved like them society would collapse. But make it clear
that it isn’t too late for them! They can repent and start creating
value for other people tomorrow. Consider: construction, manufacturing,
engineering, operations, shipping, retail, the service industry. Even
sitting in a room doing nothing would be an improvement for everyone
else.</em><br />

is bad</a> - “<em>I’m now a Hong Kong resident. I think people still
have no idea how fake the US economy is, and how bad it will get over
the next 20 years. I used to think that this was just a phenomenon in
tech, but now tech is everything. If nobody is creating the value and
everyone is trying to cannibalize, eventually there is nothing left.
You’ll know things are turning around when the money is real
again.</em>”<br />

You do not win at this game. If technology is centralized, you will be a
