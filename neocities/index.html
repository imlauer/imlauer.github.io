<p>I was born in Argentina. I studied Computer Science from <a
href="https://dcc.fceia.unr.edu.ar/es/lcc/materias">Universidad Nacional
de Rosario(Spanish)</a>. I once found a SQL Injection vuln on the old
website. Now I’m studying electricity.</p>
<p>My online nicknames are esotericwarfare, atavistic11.</p>

number 1: don’t be a sellout. Money is fake and you can’t buy a
country’s sovereignty. Don’t change your way of thinking for money. Like
Facebook employees who sell their soul to fry on private jets. Facebook,
Google, Amazon, Spotify are ads companies not “tech” companies.</h4>
<p>The biggest problems are overpopulation and zero-sum games.</p>
<p>I want money. I have high TC. I get big compensation. I advance in my
career. I have many business opportunity. I am senior employee. I have
many reports. I have big package. I am important. I fly on private jet.
I party with model. I go to prestigious school. I have piece of paper
with school logo. I think people still have no idea how fake the US
economy is, and how bad it will get over the next 20 years. I used to
think that this was just a phenomenon in tech, but now tech is
everything. If nobody is creating the value and everyone is trying to
cannibalize, eventually there is nothing left.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="some-facts">Some facts:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I used to study computer science but dropped it.<br />
</li>
<li>Capitalism is going to die unless we ban <a
href="https://wrongthink.link/posts/advertising-cancer-on-society/">ads</a>
and separate of church and state including universities.</li>
<li>I support <a
href="https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2023/04/11/wireheading-city.html">Wireheading
city</a>.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Advertising should be illegal</strong> because it is a form
of abusing because it takes advantage of stupid people.</li>
<li>The public university should be developing decentralized, free
software to evade corrupt governments and decentralized
cryptocurrencies—alternatives to make us free. Not forcing us to take
all those exams that serve no purpose other than putting a logo on a
piece of paper. That’s academic bullshit.</li>
<li>Public Universities are taxpayer-funded scams: <a
href="https://redirect.invidious.io/embed/-v8pD0d5Bmk">how not to be a
noob by george hotz</a>.</li>
<li>Society would be better if we abolished academic certificates.</li>
<li>The entire educational system is a scam because no matter what job
you do, you’re always going to encounter a problem and have to study on
your own. Nobody can teach you everything in life. The educational
system and public universities are a pyramid scheme.</li>
<li>I agree with Richard Stalman on witch hunt: <a
href="https://stallman.org/articles/witch-hunt.html">https://stallman.org/articles/witch-hunt.html</a></li>
<li><strong>Financing with advertising is equivalent to financing with
taxes</strong>.</li>
<li>Javascript was a mistake: Modern frontends so are bloated due to the
amount of spying they do and the extreme amount of advertising they
display. The solution to this is to disable JavaScript or use a browser
without JavaScript support like w3m, links, netsurf.<br />
</li>
<li>Politics is for losers.</li>
<li>You’re your 5 closest friends.</li>
<li><strong>The best method to find out if a website is really free: use
Tor and disable JavaScript and see if you can still use
it.</strong></li>
<li>COVID-19 pandemic was a planned laboratory creation: Deaths from
nukes: 226,000 - “Deaths” from COVID: 3,250,648. Complete nonsense.</li>
<li>Technology has made access cheaper and more convenient — streaming
music, movies, or storing data online costs far less than buying
physical media. However, this convenience comes with a trade-off:
<strong>users no truly own anything anymore</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>All content and services are locked behind subscriptions and
centralized platforms. If access is revoked or payment stops, everything
— music, photos, data, even communication — can disappear
instantly</strong>. This creates digital dependency and corporate
control, where participation in modern life often requires a credit card
and compliance with corporate systems. This is not what tech is about,
this is against technology.</li>
<li>Free will doesn’t exist.<br />
</li>
<li>Ads should be illegal. Advertising is like fishing, but you’re the
one who ends up getting caught.</li>
<li>Today, the internet is flooded with ads and manipulation, but “tech
companies” claim to care about stopping the spread of misinformation.
The irony is that their entire business model relies on showing us fake
ads.</li>
<li><strong><a
href="https://wrongthink.link/posts/bitcoin-is-a-tale-of-tragedy/">Bitcoin</a>’s
value is purely human stupidity</strong>: Bitcoin was not created to
speculate on its value: buying cheap and selling high. It was created to
set us free and eliminate banks and decentralized money.</li>
<li><strong>Voting is manipulation</strong>: zero-sum games are the
problem and I don’t see any politician talking about it. Additionally,
most working people don’t have the time to stay informed about the news,
so they will always end up voting wrong.</li>
<li>Modern games were created to sell expensive hardware to dumb people,
see <a href="https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack">nethack</a>, <a
href="http://www.tastyfish.cz/lrs/doom.html">DOOM</a> and <a
href="http://www.tastyfish.cz/lrs/anarch.html">Anarch by tastyfish</a>,
Diablo I, 0ad those are real games! I can play them without have to run
Xorg or Wayland just from the TTY. Nethack is a text base console game.
DOOM, Anarch, Diablo I, 0ad have SDL support.</li>
<li>Schools don’t measure intelligence, they measure “alignment with
their interests” and train you for “slavery”. True prodigies, like
programmers and chess masters, simply drop out. ( <a
href="https://redirect.invidious.io/embed/6Ptopme84Vw">Tsoding</a> ).
School blocks real education.<br />
</li>
<li>Work is better than school ( <a
href="https://digdeeper.love/articles/school.xhtml">The toxic schooling
system</a> )<br />
</li>
<li>Everyone oppresses everyone else: human existence itself is pure
egoism.<br />
</li>
<li>Google’s self-driving cars? Fake, controlled by humans. Amazon’s AI
supermarkets? Also fake, staffed by 100 Indians. <a
href="http://stallman.org/spotify.html">Spotify</a> lies about song
popularity, YouTube hides dislikes, and social media exists purely for
mass espionage and selling ads to fellow scammers.</li>
<li>Women are more emotional than men, therefore they are more
violent.</li>
<li>How to get girls: “Girls just wanna have fun”. The nightclub was
made for women, women like to dance with their friends and receive male
attention. Men go to night clubs only because there are women, not
because they like the nightclub. Women pay less. Ask yourself: How many
couples would not have been formed without the use of alcohol? <a
href="https://redirect.invidious.io/embed/he5fbPzeQKc">https://redirect.invidious.io/embed/he5fbPzeQKc</a></li>
<li>Marriage never benefits the man, always the woman, because the woman
has power over sex while the man has power over the relationship. If the
man gets married, he loses the only power he had over the
relationship.</li>
<li>As a natural leader, you have no need for validation from
anyone.</li>
<li>I view the entire “education system” as a manipulative tool designed
to train “slaves” to constantly seek external approval.<br />
</li>
<li>Social media is a tool for mass espionage, addiction, and selling
ads to exploit society.<br />
</li>
<li>C++ was created to only sell expensive books and live off of
them.<br />
</li>
<li>The power isn’t what you have, it’s what people believe you
have.<br />
</li>
<li>Most jobs are fake, so don’t worry AI won’t take away your
“job”.</li>
<li>“Skill before certification” - <a
href="https://redirect.invidious.io/embed/-v8pD0d5Bmk">George Hotz - How

<li>Watching porn, smoking cigarettes, or overeating is a way of
cheating instead of addressing the underlying problem. <strong>If you’re
fat you need to lose weight</strong>.</li>

(<a href="/rent_seeking.html">In Spanish</a>).</li>
<li>Housing is a moral issue: No one needs three homes while others have
none. Overhousing is greed — put your extra properties back on the
market.</li>
<li>Investment firms are parasites: They don’t build homes; they buy
them to drain rent from workers. Flippers and funds inflate prices and
call it “business”.</li>
<li>End infinite rent: After paying the home’s value in rent, ownership
should transfer. Rent should build equity, not vanish.</li>
<li>Ban corporate landlords: Homes belong to people, not balance sheets.
Empty houses in a housing crisis should be taxed into use.</li>
<li><a
href="https://wrongthink.link/posts/infinite-rent-unpatched-exploit/">Infinite
Rent Unpatched Exploit</a> (<a
href="/infinite-rent-unpatched-exploit.html">In Spanish</a>)</li>
<li>The goal of computer science is to automate all jobs. The more
computing advances, the more people lose work. That’s why there is no
real money in tech: if you are honest, each passing year programming
work gets harder and pays worse.</li>
<li>If you are a con artist like Mark Zuckerberg—whose core aim is to
make you addicted to your phone to show you ads—or companies like <a
href="http://stallman.org/spotify.html">Spotify</a>, Tinder that charges
the same to men and women and Tinder doesn’t ask the body count (very
important question if you’re looking for some casual sex) or Ex-Twitter
show fake “trends”, then you can make money. Companies like <a
href="http://stallman.org/netflix.html">Netflix</a> that turned people
who once used torrents into paying subscribers, or Google that censors
piracy and sites without Google Adsense while promoting Reddit, or Udemy
selling low-quality courses, or all the aggressive marketing that pushes
you to create accounts on shady sites or crypto scams. But that is NOT
technology; technology is supposed to improve our lives, not make us
addicted to advertising or be Ponzi-style scams or zero-sum games.</li>
<li>Tech companies intentionally worsen their products to make more
money. Programming died ten years ago; they tried to delay artificial
intelligence because they want to live off fake jobs a computer can
do.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes">Elizabeth
Holmes</a> was used as a scapegoat—unjustly blamed for a larger failure.
The investors who put money into that mess should be thoroughly
investigated.</li>
<li>In technology there is no real money. Most people didn’t care about
tech; they came because they heard there was money and then scammed
others: <a href="http://stallman.org/spotify.html">Spotify</a>
manipulates song popularity; YouTube removed dislikes; Facebook
maximizes phone addiction to show as much advertising as possible.</li>
<li>The original purpose of <strong>Bitcoin was to destroy banks and
evade taxes</strong>. The fact that banks now sell Bitcoin demonstrates
they are working against the technology’s initial goals.</li>
<li>There is no money in technology: <strong>most tech companies lie to
society because they know people will buy stocks without understanding
the product</strong>. Examples: Elizabeth Holmes raised hundreds of
millions and valued Theranos at $9 billion while deceiving
investors.</li>
<li>The COVID origin debate persists?… It came from a lab.</li>
<li>What matters to Facebook/Meta is maximizing phone addiction to show
as much advertising as possible. They may think it’s genius, but it’s
fraud. Advertising should be illegal or heavily taxed so it’s not
profitable. If we abolish advertising, many so-called journalists would
have to work in construction, and the country would improve.</li>
<li>Teachers punish students for using Artificial Intelligence—again the
education system fails to encourage critical thinking.</li>
<li><em>“You heard there was money and status in tech. You applied. You
never cared about technology; you wanted to get rich. You’re a parasitic
infiltrator. It’s time for you to leave. You won’t go voluntarily. We
must act: give everything away for free so you have no reason to be
here.”</em> - George Hotz.</li>
<li>In poor countries the struggle is not against nature but against
zero-sum games and scams. Real economic growth is only about 3% — any
gain above that often means someone else loses.</li>
<li>“The simplification changes the meaning” - Richard Stallman.</li>
<li><strong>For marketing, the truth doesn’t matter, what only matter is
what sells and raises stock prices</strong>. <em>YouTube removed
dislikes and promotes youtube-shorts to show more ads</em>, then they
“worry” and remove videos for “misinformation”.</li>
<li>Before Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, people used P2P networks like
Ares, Emule, Torrent to share music, but everything was corrupted by
power, if you don’t believe me, watch this <a
href="https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=ZfOwwCoR0dE&amp;list=PLTChAOKYIS4QYWmMt83YuQcKyjuocSrT5">movie</a>.</li>
<li>Statistics are a new form of advertising.<br />
</li>
<li><em>If a guy squeezes a girl’s breast without consent, he doesn’t
physically hurt her in any way, the girl is completely fine, it’s just
that society will tell her she was “raped” by this and should now start
suffering from PTSD, she’s labeled a “victim”, assigned a psychiatrist,
will be pumped with drugs and told she has an increased chance of
committing suicide now. In a good society this would simply not be the
case, mild non-consensual sexual behavior such as touching, spying,
masturbation etc. might be at worst as much harmful as for example
non-consensual small talk or farting in someone’s presence without his
approval. Again, physically harming someone is WRONG, but do we have to
equate such an extreme form of rape with slapping a girl’s ass? By doing
so we are probably hurting the “victims” more than the “offenders”. But
again, this helps separate people into two groups: “raped” and “not
raped”, “victims” and “predators” and so on.</em> - LRS Wiki.</li>
<li><a href="https://archive.is/hk4p0">What if the real fascists are the
ones against fascism?</a>.</li>
<li>Vibecoding(prompt engineering) is a scam: You’re still doing the
coding, you’re just using a different language (English, in this case),
and English is a poor language for coding due to its imprecision. The
moment you need to accomplish something new, you’ll have to be as
specific as possible, and the only reason it works for many common
programming workflows is because they are common, the minute you try to
do new things, you need to be as verbose as the underlying
language.</li>
<li>In Argentina, internet service providers like Claro, Personal, and
Movistar block access to <a
href="https://librefutbol.su">https://librefutbol.su</a> by DNS, due to
few customers are willing to pay for the premium channels, Google
removes all the piracy links which is why I use <a
href="https://yandex.com">Yandex</a> and torrent search with
<strong>qBitTorrent, btstrm</strong> with <strong>Jackett</strong>.</li>
<li>I believe most of <strong>social media influencers are
psychopaths</strong> that are willing to promote any scam like VPN
scams, online gambling and resell cheap clothing at a high price, in
order to profit from their followers. They are the suckers of
society.</li>
<li><a
href="https://wrongthink.link/posts/discord-inferior-alternative-to-mumble/">Discord
is an Inferior Alternative to Mumble</a></li>
<li>The fewer dependencies you have, the better: Having fewer
dependencies makes it easier to maintain that’s why I use
<code>pandoc</code> and <code>markdown</code> and can just use html also
or <code>cmark</code> that’s more minimalistic than
<code>pandoc</code>.</li>
<li>I read news through RSS with <code>newsraft</code> and
<code>newsboat</code>.</li>
<li>I love all that lives, even those that cause me pain.</li>
<li>Wanna learn about finances?: <a

<li>Due to my laptop’s slow performance, I spoof my User-Agent to make
it seem like I’m accessing from an Android device, which allows me to
load resource-intensive sites like Twitch and YouTube more quickly.</li>
<li>For Zoomers a mail client is an “app”.<br />
</li>
<li>VPNs are a scam: They could potentially analyze and log all your
traffic and sell it to third parties, governments, three letter
agencies, etc. Use Tor instead. VPNs might be useful when you need to
use a service that blocks Tor, but the rest of the time it’s advisable
to use Tor and not a VPN. If you still want to use want, remember to pay
with cash or Monero.</li>

<li><strong>Intelligence is genetic</strong>, and one cannot study to
become intelligent; access to information is already available and
there’s still a lot of retarded people like me.</li>
<li>Harvard costs $70,000 per year to study something you can find on
Internet, I don’t understand why people pay that. Buy your kid a house
instead, lol.</li>
<li><strong>The “educational system” (schools and universities) does not
measure intelligence. Instead, they measure how much you question what
you are told to do</strong>.</li>
<li>Schools destroy autonomy, which in turn destroys intelligence.</li>
<li>When a student uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) for homework, they
demonstrate a lack of <strong>motivation</strong> or interest in the
subject matter, which is the true problem.</li>
<li>University education is a <strong>zero-sum game</strong> that serves
no beneficial purpose to society.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>True technology is decentralized</strong>. Decentralized
technology gives power over money and data to the individual.</li>
<li>Examples of true decentralized technology include the original
Internet, email (SMTP), torrents, and Bitcoin (in its original
form).</li>
<li><strong>“Centralized technology” is anti-technology</strong> and
leads to <strong><a
href="https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2025/10/06/always-been-at-war.html">slavery</a></strong>.
Centralization gives power over money and data to the corporation.</li>
<li>Centralized AI will make humanity slaves; therefore, technology must
be decentralized.</li>
<li><strong>There is no money in true decentralized technology</strong>.
Companies hate decentralized technology because they cannot profit from
it.</li>
<li>“Tech companies” (BigTech) realized they couldn’t make money from
decentralized systems, so they began to centralize everything, which is
their true objective.</li>
<li>Examples of centralized anti-technology include Discord, Slack,
Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook/Meta, Netflix, Spotify, and banks
selling Bitcoin.</li>
<li>Many “technological” companies intentionally <strong>worsen their
products</strong> (e.g., Google search results, Amazon) in order to earn
more money.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Most “tech companies” are fundamentally <strong>advertising
companies</strong>.</li>
<li>Companies like Facebook/Meta use the most advanced AI in the world
to train people’s brains to consume advertising and become addicted to
their screens.</li>
<li>Facebook “gives away” cell phones in poor countries, recovering the
cost through advertising, which is viewed as a form of abuse.</li>
<li>Activities that are <strong>“zero-sum games”</strong> (not creating
value, only extracting it) should be heavily taxed or outlawed. These
include: advertising, marketing, finance, rentals/real estate,
reselling, journalism, and tip applications.</li>
<li>Mark Zuckerberg should close Facebook and live off the state because
his work does not serve society, but rather aims to make people addicted
to advertising.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>The entire society is influenceable; <strong>free will does not
exist</strong>.</li>
<li>The goal of technology should be to replace the useful functions of
the State with locally controlled machines, causing the <strong>State to
weaken and die by disruption</strong>.</li>
<li>The system rewards those who create “traps for humans,” not those
who help others.</li>
<li>The State, the church, and the universities should be
separated.</li>

<p><em>Do you know someone who works in real estate, finance, sales, tip
screen design, or advertising? You can nudge them in the right
direction! Explain to them how their job is making the world worse. How
if everyone behaved like them society would collapse. But make it clear
that it isn’t too late for them! They can repent and start creating
value for other people tomorrow. Consider: construction, manufacturing,
engineering, operations, shipping, retail, the service industry. Even
sitting in a room doing nothing would be an improvement for everyone
else.</em><br />

is bad</a> - “<em>I’m now a Hong Kong resident. I think people still
have no idea how fake the US economy is, and how bad it will get over
the next 20 years. I used to think that this was just a phenomenon in
tech, but now tech is everything. If nobody is creating the value and
everyone is trying to cannibalize, eventually there is nothing left.
You’ll know things are turning around when the money is real
again.</em>”</li>

currently looking, despite it becoming as easy as taking candy from a
baby, people will not give up their desire for power over other people.
You do not win at this game. If technology is centralized, you will be a
slave. The boot stomping on a human face. You will not be one of the 6
winners. There won’t even be 6 winners, the winners will continue to
fight with you in the middle until there’s 1 winner. And that winner
isn’t really a winner. If one person ends up with all the money, the
money is worthless.</em>”</li>

continue to make building new houses hard. (supply and demand bro gotta

tech companies) rent seek and nickel and dime you on everything, and
hire psychologists to further bypass your conscious thought. Continue to
give massive loans out in exchange for a worthless education, and watch
