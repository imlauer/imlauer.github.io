<h2>Andrew Imlauer's Personal Page</h2>
</center>

<p>
This is a website of someone who is not brainwashed.
</p>

<p>
I love everyone and I wanna hug you.
</p>

<p>
I am an associate member of the Free Software Foundation, a developer on the GNU Operating System for GNUtrition, a Computer Information.
I was born in 1995 and I live in Argentina. I studied Computer Science from Universidad Nacional de Rosario.
</p>


<p>
NOTE 2: please only trust this website and my email as I have started to share accounts and passwords with some other selected people for fun. It may happen my accounts on the Internet start doing something without it being me. You should only trust this website and my email at this point. Eventually I am aiming to make all my passwords public, but it's a far future probably.
</p>

<p>
I've been doing various minimum wage jobs such as cleaning and newspaper distribution.
</p>

<p>
My online nicks are esotericwarfare, atavistic11, dresuer.
</p>

<p>
Here is a photo of <a href="https://miinstagram.github.io/me/mpv-shot0034.jpg">me</a>
</p>

<p>
I give everyone an explicit and unconditional consent to behave sexually towards me.
</p>

<p>
I am quite lonely, if you want to FUCK let me know please (but I've never done it yet). Just a cuddle friend is okay too (I prefer biological women but who knows).
</p>

<p>
Fun facts about me:
* I am not competitive.

<ul>
<li>I am studying electricity because I like things that can actually shock me, not just bore me. (#literal)</li>
<li>I used to study computer science but dropped it, mostly because I was better at swearing at my classmates than at coding.</li>
<li>I am curious to the point of self-harm: if something has wires, I’ll touch it, even if it kills me.</li>
<li>I am obsessed with safety, yet I keep imagining how stupid my obituary would sound.</li>
<li>I can explain things clearly, but only after confusing myself first.</li>
<li>I always restart my life like Windows 98, usually right before the blue screen.</li>
<li>I am resilient, but that’s just a polite way of saying “too stubborn to stay down.”</li>
<li>I am not politically correct; if you want sugar-coating, go buy candy.</li>
<li>I am impossible to “motivate,” because I don’t believe in cheesy positivity — I’d rather laugh at the darkness.</li>
<li>I think honesty is underrated, so I prefer to sound brutal than fake.</li>
<li>I can wire a house without electrocuting myself (so far).</li>
<li>I am authentic, which is another way of saying I don’t know how to act normal.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Propaganda, cheesy positivity, political correctness, memorizing without understanding, ads, boredom, dishonesty, fake people, being stuck, not improving, cliché phrases, lack of clarity, sugar-coating, acting normal.

I like doing personal projects, which you will find in the portfolio page of this website. My specialties can be found on the homepage, of which most are devops, web

development, and cybersecurity. I am currently available for work.

</p>
<p>
During my free time, I like working on various technology and
non-technology projects, playing various video games, chatting on IRC
servers, newsgroups, and web forums, making and publishing music,
biking, listening to shortwave radio, using slow-scan television,
trying new things, volunteering for different causes, and whatever
else I find interesting.

<p>
If you're a billionaire and want to give me 6 kg of gold (enough to make me financially independent for the rest of my life) so that I don't have to beg for money and suffer everyday slavery depression and can just program for the rest of my life, that would be very nice, thank you.

<h3>About the server and my web space</h3>

This computer runs my web server, e-mail server, primary authoratative
DNS server, and primary time server, among other software and
protocols.  Most of these web pages here
are <a href="http://home.cs.umanitoba.ca/~djc/personal/lynxfriend.html">Lynx
friendly</a>
and <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">designed to
last</a>.  These web pages are maintained in a simple way: manually as
HTML.  The goal is to just present information, views, software,
projects, and some action opportunities.  If there is something you
would like for me to write about, either here or on a blog, you
can <a href="mailto:anton+suggest@next.gen.oh.us">e-mail me</a>
with your ideas.

<h3>A <a name=professional>professional bio</a></h3>

Anton McClure is the lead maintainer of GNUtrition, a student at the
University of Akron, and a card-carrying member of the Free Software
Foundation.
<p>
McClure has administered servers since 2014, typically using free
software POSIX compliant operating systems such as GNU/Linux and
FreeBSD.  In the past, he has also hosted servers and services using
the Microsoft Windows Server operating system.  A good example of one
of these machines is the private shell account server on
next.gen.oh.us.  Since 2024, McClure has worked with the
University of Akron's College of Business Administration's computer
labs, and previously worked at the University of Akron's Information
Technology Services with the IT User Services team. He also attends
classes at the university towards a Bachelor's of Science in Computer
Information Systems for the Programming option, and has previously
completed the requirements for an Associate of Applied Business also
in Computer Information Systems.
<p>
McClure has also volunteered to maintain different web sites and
utilities. Some of the HTML and software code he has written runs on
several web sites ranging from the top 20,000 to the top 100.  McClure
plans to continue making further contributions to some of these web
sites and servers for the foreseeable future. He is also the
maintainer of GNUtrition, a free nutrition analysis software written
for the GNU operating system. He has also worked with several people
from the Free Software Foundation and GNU project, among other free
software organizations and supporters, and plans to continue doing as
some of his long-term commitments.
