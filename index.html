<h2>Andres Imlauer's Personal Page</h2>

<p>
I was born in 1995 and I live in Argentina. I studied Computer Science from Universidad Nacional de Rosario. Now I'm studying electricity.
</p>

<p>
I've been doing various minimum wage jobs such as cleaning, computer repair and camera installation.
</p>

<p>
My online nicks are esotericwarfare, atavistic11.

<h3>Fun facts about me:</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>I am studying electricity because I like things that can actually shock me, not just bore me.</li>
<li>I used to study computer science but dropped it.</li>
<li>Capitalism is going to die: Capitalism has no morals; it’s pure consumption.</li>
<li>I support <a href="https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2023/04/11/wireheading-city.html">Wireheading city</a>.</li>
<li>Everything is a lie: news, porn, music, education, democracy. It's all manipulation.</li>
<li>Public Universities are taxpayer-funded scams.</li>
<li>Feminism is a male construct designed to oppress other men.</li>
<li>COVID-19 pandemic was a planned laboratory creation.</li>
<li>Civilization will end in a decade or two.</li>
<li>Free will doesn't exist.</li>
<li>Bitcoin's value is purely "human stupidity"</li>
<li>Voting is pointless.</li>
<li>Schools don't measure intelligence, they measure "alignment with their interests" and train you for "slavery". True prodigies, like programmers and chess masters, simply drop out.</li>
<li>School blocks real education.</li>
<li>Everyone oppresses everyone else: human existence itself is pure egoism.</li>
<li>Google's self-driving cars? Fake, controlled by humans. Amazon's AI supermarkets? Also fake, staffed by 100 Indians. Spotify lies about song popularity, YouTube hides dislikes, and social media exists purely for mass espionage and selling ads to fellow scammers.</li>
<li>As a natural leader, you have no need for validation from anyone. You view the entire education system as a manipulative tool designed to train "slaves" to constantly seek external approval.</li>
<li>Social media is a tool for mass espionage, addiction, and selling ads to exploit society.</li>
<li>Be the seller, not the buyer.</li>
<li>C++ was created to only sell expensive books and live off of them.</li>
<li>The power isn't what you have, it's what people believe you have.</li>
<li>Most jobs are fake.</li>
<li>Statistics are a new form of advertising.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Some things I like (no particular order):</h3>

<p>
Computers, Programming, Electricity, installations, circuits, safety.
</p>

During my free time, I like working on various technology and
non-technology projects, playing various video games, chatting on IRC
